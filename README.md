# CS50W Final Project — Calorie Tracker

A full-stack calorie tracking web application that generates **personalized nutrition plans** based on a user’s details, fitness goals, and dietary preferences. Once a plan is created, users can track their daily intake by logging foods consumed through a searchable food database.

## Features

### Onboarding
After signup, the user completes a questionnaire collecting personal details, goals, and dietary preferences. This information is used to generate the user’s nutrition plan.

### Daily Food Logger
Users can log meals for the day by searching for foods from the database. The logger allows users to add foods to their daily intake and track progress toward their calorie and macronutrient targets.
